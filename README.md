Pillararene hosts: the water-soluble carboxylated-pillar[6]arene (WP6)

The detailed investigation of energetics, atomic forces and dynamic behaviors produced by transferable GAFF derivatives suggests that none of these popular pre-fitted parameter sets are able to accurately describe pillararenes. 

We thus pursue close-to-ab-initio descriptions via regularized force-matching refitting. The reference level is the balanced B97-3c composite method, and 9000 configurations are gathered to generate reference data. 

The refitted FM-B97-3c parameters that accurately reproduce ab initio results are provided, for researchers to apply these high-accuracy parameters in future invesitgations relating to this host family. The files for GAFF derivatives are also provided for comparison.
